## 🤖 AI Prompts for Customization

### Step 1: Rename App

```
@flutter-developer Please rename this Flutter app:
- Current name: "min_flutter_template"
- New name: "my_awesome_app"
- Current package: "com.cmwen.min_flutter_template"
- New package: "com.mycompany.my_awesome_app"

Update all necessary files including:
- pubspec.yaml
- lib/main.dart (imports and title)
- test/widget_test.dart (imports)
- android/app/build.gradle.kts (namespace and applicationId)
- android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml (label)
- web/manifest.json (name and short_name)
- iOS bundle identifier (provide instructions for Xcode)
- macOS bundle identifier (provide instructions for Xcode)

After updating, run `flutter pub get` and verify everything compiles.
```

### Step 2: Generate App Icon

```
@icon-generation.prompt.md

Create an app launcher icon for my [TYPE OF APP] app.

Requirements:
- App concept: [DESCRIBE YOUR APP]
- Style: [flat/gradient/minimal/modern]
- Primary color: #[HEX CODE]
- Secondary color: #[HEX CODE]
- Symbol/concept: [DESCRIBE ICON CONCEPT]
- Background: [transparent/solid color]

Please provide:
1. A 1024×1024 PNG master icon
2. Instructions for using flutter_launcher_icons package
3. Alt text for accessibility

Save the master icon to `assets/icon/app_icon.png` and help me set up 
flutter_launcher_icons in pubspec.yaml.
```

### Step 3: Customize Theme

```
@flutter-developer Please customize the app theme in lib/main.dart:

Brand colors:
- Primary: #[HEX] ([COLOR NAME])
- Secondary: #[HEX] ([COLOR NAME])
- Background: #[HEX]
- Surface: #[HEX]
- Error: #[HEX]

Requirements:
- Use Material Design 3
- Support dark mode
- Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios
- Use ColorScheme.fromSeed for consistency

Also update web/manifest.json with matching theme_color and background_color.
```

### Step 4: Define Product Requirements

```
@product-owner I want to build a [TYPE OF APP] with the following capabilities:

Core features:
1. [FEATURE 1]
2. [FEATURE 2]
3. [FEATURE 3]

Target users:
- [USER PERSONA 1]
- [USER PERSONA 2]

Key user goals:
- [GOAL 1]
- [GOAL 2]

Success metrics:
- [METRIC 1]
- [METRIC 2]

Please create:
1. Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
2. Feature prioritization (MVP vs future)
3. Non-functional requirements
4. Success metrics and KPIs

Save requirements to docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
```

### Step 5: Design User Experience

```
@experience-designer Based on the product requirements in docs/REQUIREMENTS.md, 
please design:

1. Information architecture (screen hierarchy)
2. Navigation structure (tab bar, drawer, or stack-based)
3. User flows for key features:
   - [FLOW 1]
   - [FLOW 2]
   - [FLOW 3]
4. Wireframes for main screens
5. Accessibility considerations

Constraints:
- Platform: [Android/iOS/Web/All]
- Target devices: [Mobile/Tablet/Desktop]
- Material Design 3 components

Save design to docs/UX_DESIGN.md with ASCII wireframes or descriptions.
```

### Step 6: Research Dependencies

```
@researcher I need to find the best Flutter packages for:

1. State Management - [brief description of needs]
2. Local Database - [data structure and requirements]
3. HTTP Client - [API integration needs]
4. [OTHER CATEGORY] - [requirements]

For each category, please:
- Recommend top 3 packages with pros/cons
- Check latest version and maintenance status
- Verify compatibility with Flutter 3.10+
- Consider package size and performance
- Check license compatibility

Save findings to docs/DEPENDENCIES_RESEARCH.md
```

### Step 7: Plan Architecture

```
@architect Based on the requirements and dependencies research, please design:

Project structure:
- Folder organization (screens, widgets, models, services, providers)
- State management pattern
- Data layer architecture
- API integration approach
- Navigation structure

Technical decisions:
- State management: [Provider/Riverpod/Bloc/GetX]
- Local storage: [shared_preferences/sqflite/hive/isar]
- HTTP client: [dio/http/chopper]
- Dependency injection approach
- Error handling strategy
- Logging approach

Provide:
1. Directory structure with purpose of each folder
2. Data flow diagram
3. Key architectural patterns to follow
4. Code organization guidelines

Save to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

### Step 8: Implement First Feature

```
@flutter-developer Implement [FEATURE NAME] feature:

Requirements:
- [REQUIREMENT 1]
- [REQUIREMENT 2]
- [REQUIREMENT 3]

Acceptance criteria:
- [CRITERION 1]
- [CRITERION 2]

Technical approach:
- Follow architecture in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Create necessary models in lib/models/
- Implement UI in lib/screens/[feature_name]/
- Use widgets from lib/widgets/ for reusable components
- Implement business logic in lib/services/
- Add state management with [chosen solution]

After implementation:
1. Write unit tests for business logic
2. Write widget tests for UI components
3. Run `dart format .`
4. Run `flutter analyze`
5. Run `flutter test`
6. Document any public APIs
```

### Step 9: Set Up GitHub Repository

```
@terminal Please help me set up my GitHub repository:

1. Create repository on GitHub: [REPO_URL]
2. Update git remote:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin [REPO_URL]
   ```
3. Update astro/astro.config.mjs with correct username and repo name
4. Create initial commit with customizations
5. Push to main branch

Then guide me through setting up GitHub Secrets for signed releases.
```

### Step 10: Create Release Build

```
@flutter-developer Please help me create the first release build:

1. Verify all customizations are complete
2. Update version in pubspec.yaml to 1.0.0+1
3. Build release artifacts:
   - Android: APK and AAB
   - iOS: IPA (if on macOS)
   - Web: production build
4. Test release build on device
5. Create git tag v1.0.0
6. Push tag to trigger release workflow

Provide step-by-step commands.
```
