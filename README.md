git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Verify everything works
flutter test && flutter analyze
```

### 2. Customize Your App (Use AI!)

```
@flutter-developer Please rename this app from "min_flutter_template" 
to "my_awesome_app" with package "com.mycompany.my_awesome_app"
```

**See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for complete setup guide.**

### 3. Generate App Icon

```
@icon-generation.prompt.md Create an app icon for my [describe app] 
with primary color #3B82F6 in minimal style
```

### 4. Build and Run

```bash
flutter run -d chrome      # Web
flutter run -d android     # Android
flutter build apk          # Release APK
```

## 🤖 AI-Powered Development

### Meet Your AI Team

This template includes 6 specialized AI agents for VS Code:

| Agent | Purpose | Example Usage |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **@product-owner** | Define features & requirements | `@product-owner Create user stories for a note-taking app` |
| **@experience-designer** | Design UX & user flows | `@experience-designer Design the login and onboarding flow` |
| **@architect** | Plan technical architecture | `@architect How should I structure authentication?` |
| **@researcher** | Find packages & best practices | `@researcher Best packages for local database in Flutter` |
| **@flutter-developer** | Implement features & fix bugs | `@flutter-developer Implement login screen with validation` |
| **@doc-writer** | Write documentation | `@doc-writer Document the authentication API` |

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Define your app concept
@product-owner I want to build a recipe app with categories, 
search, and favorites. Create user stories and MVP scope.

# 2. Design the experience
@experience-designer Based on the requirements, design the 
information architecture and main user flows.

# 3. Research dependencies
@researcher What packages do I need for local storage, 
images, and JSON parsing?

# 4. Plan architecture
@architect Design the app architecture with Riverpod state management 
and repository pattern for recipes.

# 5. Implement features
@flutter-developer Implement the recipe list screen with 
category filtering and search.

# 6. Write documentation
@doc-writer Document the recipe repository API and usage examples.
```

**All agents have access to VS Code terminal, debugger, and test runner!**

## ⚡ Build Performance

This template includes **comprehensive build optimizations**:

- **Java 17 baseline** for modern Android development
- **Parallel builds** with 4 workers (local) / 2 workers (CI)
- **Multi-level caching**: Gradle, Flutter SDK, pub packages, npm
- **R8 code shrinking**: 40-60% smaller release APKs
- **Concurrency control**: Cancels duplicate CI runs
- **CI-optimized Gradle properties**: Separate config for CI vs local

### Expected Build Times

| Environment | Build Type | Time |
|------------|-----------|------|
| Local (cached) | Debug APK | 30-60s |
| Local | Release APK | 1-2 min |
| CI (cached) | Full workflow | 3-5 min |

**See [BUILD_OPTIMIZATION.md](BUILD_OPTIMIZATION.md) for details.**

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflows

### Automated Workflows

- **build.yml**: Tests, lints, builds on every push (30min timeout)
- **release.yml**: Signed releases on version tags (45min timeout)
- **pre-release.yml**: Manual beta/alpha releases (workflow_dispatch)
- **deploy-website.yml**: Deploys docs to GitHub Pages

### Setup Signed Releases

```bash
# 1. Generate keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias release

# 2. Add GitHub Secrets
- ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64: `base64 -i release.jks | pbcopy`
- ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
- ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS: release
- ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD

# 3. Tag and push
git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags
```
